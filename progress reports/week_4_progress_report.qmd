## What you accomplished (or attempted) this week:

I was able to complete all visualization for Question 1 of my proposal. I have currently started Question 2 and 

## Any setbacks/roadblocks you experienced:

The scatterplot for the first visual of Q1 seems to show no trends, the points are everywhere. I will need to divide up the data by education category to see if there will be trends for individual education level scatterplots.

## Are you on track? If not, how will you get back on track?
