**Total \# of hours worked this week: [9 hours]**

## What you accomplished (or attempted) this week:

I finished Questions 6 and 7.

## Any setbacks/roadblocks you experienced:

I had to change the visuals for Q6 and Q7 as opposed to the suggested ones in the proposal.
I have not finished Q6.

## What you plan to work on next:

I have several plots for both Q6 and Q7, I want to pick the best ones only. 
I also want to go through my code and add comments and clean it up.

## Are you on track? If not, how will you get back on track?

A little off track, still need to finish Q6.
