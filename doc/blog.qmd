## Introduction




**Welcome** to *my* ~~super~~ SUPER awesome `blog` post!
$$x^2 = 1$$

## The Data

```{python}
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib as plt
import plotly.express as px

adult_df = pd.read_csv('C:/Users/nickn/OneDrive/Desktop/Capstone Project/capstone/data/adult.data', header=None, na_values=" ?")

adult_df.columns = ["age", "workclass", "fnlwgt", "education", "education-num", 
                      "marital-status", "occupation", "relationship", "race", "sex",
                      "capital-gain", "capital-loss", "hours-per-week", "native-country", "salary"]
```

This section was copy/pasted from various parts of the [Quarto website](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/hello/vscode.html).

:::{.callout-note}
Note that there are five types of callouts, including:
`note`, `tip`, `warning`, `caution`, and `important`.

## Tip With Caption

This is an example of a callout with a caption.

## Q7 Case Study: 


For your reference, here's an example of a Python code cell in Quarto, along with a figure that gets generated, along with a caption and a label so that it can be referred to automatically as "Figure 1" (or whatever) in the writeup.

For a demonstration of a line plot on a polar axis, see @fig-polar.

```{python}
#| label: fig-polar
#| fig-cap: "A line plot on a polar axis"

import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

r = np.arange(0, 2, 0.01)
theta = 2 * np.pi * r
fig, ax = plt.subplots(
  subplot_kw = {'projection': 'polar'} 
)
ax.plot(theta, r)
ax.set_rticks([0.5, 1, 1.5, 2])
ax.grid(True)
plt.show()
```

Here's an example of citing a source [see @phil99, pp. 33-35]. Be sure the source information is entered in "BibTeX" form in the `references.bib` file.


The bibliography will automatically be generated, listing all sources in the `.bib` file.
