        "\n",
        "A person's salary is determined using various pieces of personal information. Factors such as education level, marital status, and country of birth can lend valuable understanding to current college students on their future careers. These insights help set competitive attitudes, assist in salary negotiations, and create new approaches toward wage equality. Through careful data analysis with the use of machine learning and visualizations, it is possible to predict a person's salary category using their personal information. The visualizations and predictions will show potential trends in people based on their characteristics and profession and help envision a base wage for a person, useful in advertizing potential career choices to students.\n",

Using the numerical salaries ot the \"Ask A Manager Salary Survey 2021 (Responses) - Form Responses 1.csv\" file, the values will be converted to USD. Then, the numerical values will randomly populate the salary column in adult.data, with values being inserted based on the previous categories (ex. person with salary <=50k might get a value of 48056). \n",

Using a scatterplot, the annual salary in USD can be plotted against the weekly hours worked. In turn the points are colored by the level of education. To create a more presentable visual, education level will be grouped into 3 categories (Primary, Secondary, Higher). \n",

First, the data will be divided into male and female dataframes. The average salary will be calculated for males and female, this will be plotted on a bar graph. As for race and age, similar steps will be taken to create two more bar graphs (data divided by race and averages calculated).\n",

A logistic regression model will be created using the adult.data file, the salary column will be the target variable and the rest of the column the features. The data will be standardized and split into training and testing sets, and the accuracy of the model will be recorded. Also, the feature coefficients will be noted for determining which features are most important in increasing the salary.\n",
